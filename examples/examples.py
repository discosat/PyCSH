"""
Contains examples of using the libparam Python bindings and its utilities.
See: 'pycsh.pyi' for functions and classes available once the bindings have been imported.

Please note that the 'PYTHONPATH' and 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variables must be
set to point at the directory of the python bindings shared object before they may be imported.

Compiling, importing the bindings and running these examples:
    - Set 'enable_python3_bindings' to true in 'meson_options.txt'.
    - cd into project directory.
    - (If submodules are absent) Run: "git submodule update --init --recursive"
    - Compile with meson using: "./configure && ./build".
    - Run these examples (with the proper environment variables) using:
    "PYTHONPATH=builddir/lib/param LD_LIBRARY_PATH=builddir/lib/param python3 lib/param/bindings/python/examples.py"

The examples start executing at "if __name__ == '__main__'".
